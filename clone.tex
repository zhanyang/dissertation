\chapter{Range-clone}
\label{chap:clone}

This chapter describes another \bet operation, range-clone, which can be used
to implement file or directory clones and renames on full-path-indexed \betrfs.
Unlikely a range-rename, which completes all its work at once, a range-clone
injects a new type of message, \goto messages, to the \bet.
The \bet then flushes \goto messages with other messages in batches, gradually
finishing the range-clone works.
Therefore, range-clone fits into the write-optimized framework of \bets.

This chapter first describes the range-clone interface,
followed by how range-clones are implemented on \bets.
At last, this chapter describes a new technique, preferential splitting, which
makes range-clones more efficient.
