In full-path-indexed file systems, logically related data and metadata
are grouped together in the keyspace.
Therefore, full-path-indexed file systems have much better locality than
traditional inode-based file systems.
On the other hand, in full-path-indexed file systems, a rename must update all
related keys, which can be very expensive.
However, a full-path-indexed file system implemented on write-optimized
dictionaries can have efficient namespace operations by transferring them into
dictionary-internal operations.
We demonstrate this with two case studies: renaming (preliminary work) and
cloning (proposed work).
