\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:bg}

This chapter gives the background of \betrfs.
\betrfs is a full-path-indexed file system based on write-optimized \bets.
The benefit of write-optimized \bets is random write performance,
while the benefit of full-path-indexing is spatial locality, even in an aged
file system.
This chapter introduces \bets and then the full-path-indexing schema of \betrfs.
