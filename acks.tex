I would like to thank my advisor, Donald E. Porter.
During the past six years in the OSCAR Lab, I have received a great deal of support from him.
He has invested enormous time and energy to guide me in the world of system
reasearch.

I would also like to thank my committee members,
Leonard McMillan,
F. Donelson Smith,
Rob Johnson,
and Ethan L. Miller.
I am grateful for all their help and insightful suggestions to this dissertation.

Many thanks to professors and students in the amazing \betrfs project.
The project would not have been so successful without them.
Special thanks go to William Jannen and Jun Yuan,
who laid the foundation of the \betrfs implementation.

In addition, I would like to thank my friends in Stony Brook and Chapel
Hill.
They supported me greatly and were always willing to help me.
Life would have been much harder without them.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for their everlasting support.
